# scraper_db

This backend application is built using **JavaScript**, **MySQL2**, **Sequelize**, and **Express.js**. It provides a RESTful API for managing and interacting with data stored in a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for developing this backend application.
- **MySQL2**: A MySQL client for Node.js that supports both MySQL and MariaDB, providing support for SQL queries, connection management, and more.
- **Sequelize**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js, used to interact with the MySQL database in an object-oriented manner. Sequelize simplifies database queries and schema management.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to build the RESTful API. It handles HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: The application exposes various API endpoints to interact with the database, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Sequelize Models**: Database models are defined using Sequelize, making it easy to map JavaScript objects to database tables.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling mechanisms to ensure proper API response management.
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports different environment configurations using environment variables for database connections and other settings.
